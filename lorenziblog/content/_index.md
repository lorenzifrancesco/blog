# Welcome to my projects page!

<img src="/images/email.jpg" alt="Nice pic" style="width:30%; float:right; margin:1rem;">
I'm a Postdoctoral researcher in Photonics and Electromagnetics at the department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova.
I was a Ph.D. student of Theoretical Physics of Matter up to September 2025, and will graduate next year.

My current research interests are in photonic devices and theoretical aspects of light propagation:
- propagation in hollow-core fibers
- guided slow light and electromagnetic induced transparency
- nonlinear effects on guided propagation and on optical signal transmission
- geometric algebra for classical electrodynamics

I am also interested in 
- solitons and their stability in classical and quantum field theories
- nonlinear phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates, Josephson oscillations

My personal interests are mathematics, especially analysis and geometry, philosophy of science, RF and microwave electronics, and music. 
Over the years I built an electronics lab, and lately I got the amateur radio operator license with callsign [IU3UHF](see also my website where I collect experiments I do in my lab over the weekends https://www.qsl.net/iu3uhf).
