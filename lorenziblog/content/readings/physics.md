Here I collect some interesting bibliography in physics, that I have read or I am reading in this moment.

### Photonics and Electromagnetics
A book with which I am in love and have followed me for many years is 
- *Electromagnetic Waves*, C. G. Someda, CRC Press (2006)
### Quantum optics and noise
- *Quantum noise - a Handbook of Markovian and Non-Markovian methods with Applications to Quantum Optics*, C. W. Gardiner and P. Zoller, Springer (1999)
- *Elements of Quantum Optics*, P. Meystre and M. Sargent III, Springer (2007)
- *Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics*, L. Mandel and E. Wolf, Cambridge University Press (1995)

## Condensed Matter Physics 
- *Many-particle Physics*, G. Mahan, Kluwer Academic (1990)
