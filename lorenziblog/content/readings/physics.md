Here I collect some interesting bibliography in physics, that I have read or I am reading in this moment.

### Photonics and Electromagnetics
A book with which I am deeply in love and have followed me for many years is 
- *Electromagnetic Waves*, C. G. Someda.

### Quantum optics and noise
- *Quantum noise - a Handbook of Markovian and Non-Markovian methods with Applications to Quantum Optics*, C. W. Gardiner and P. Zoller.
- *Elements of Quantum Optics*, P. Meystre and M. Sargent III.
- *Optical Coherence and Quantum Optics*, L. Mandel and E. Wolf.

## Condensed Matter Physics 
- *Many-particle Physics*, G. Mahan.
- *Superfluid states of matter*, Svistunov, Babaev, Prokof'ev.
