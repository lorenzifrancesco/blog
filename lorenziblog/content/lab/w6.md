<div style="text-align: justify;">
Some time ago I repaired with a friend an old oscilloscope: a Grunding Oszilloskop GO10, rated 10MHz, dual channel, single trigger.

A quite standard design, but with an important difference compared to typical analog oscilloscopes: it is all made with discrete components.

The oscilloscope was retrieved from old equipment, and had the following problem.
While the horizontal circuit seemed alright, with correct speeping of the beam position, and triggering, the vertical circuit was insensible to controls, displaying in the screen a vertical band occupying the whole screen.
