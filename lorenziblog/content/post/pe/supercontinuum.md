### Phenomenology of supercontinuum generation

When a pulse propagates in a nonlinear fiber, it can happen that the interplay between dispersion and nonlinear processes generate a massive broadening of the spectrum.
Processes contributing to this phenonmenology are Kerr-induced four-wave mixing (FWM), self-phase modulation (SPM), stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS).
