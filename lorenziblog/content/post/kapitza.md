The Kapitza pendulum is a model in classical mechanics that exibits conunterintuitive behaviour. It is a pendulum with a pivot point that oscillates vertically. If $\phi$ is the angle the pendulum have with respect to the vertical downward position, for some values of the driving frequency and amplitude, it can be stable in the inverted position $\phi = \pi$, and unstable in the upright position $\phi = 0$. This is the opposite of what happens for a normal pendulum, which has always a stable equilibrium point with $\phi=0$ and unstable one with $\phi=\pi$.
