Consider an electromagnetic field in a laser cavity with a mirror moving with velocity $v=\beta c$.
Suppose to neglect polarization. So the transverse field $E(x, t)$ satisfy boundary conditions
$$
E(0, t) = 0
$$
and, in the transformed reference frame
$$
E(L_0 + vt, t) - \beta H(L_0+vt, t) = 0
$$
We seek solutions as superposition of plane waves, so we have

$$
  E(x, t) = f(x-ct)-f(-x-ct)   $$

$$  H(x, t) = f(x-ct)+f(-x-ct)  $$

where $f$ is an arbitrary function. The boundary conditions become
$$
  (1-\beta) \ f(L_0-ct(1-\beta)) = (1+\beta) \ f(-L_0-ct(1+\beta)) 
$$
We now find the exact solution of the above equation
