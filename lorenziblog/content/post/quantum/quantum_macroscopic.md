This article may be of some help in demistifying the fact that quantum mechanics is expected to appear only in small scales compared to our common experience.

- Weber bars
- Squeezed states of EM radiations

> If macroscopic systems cannot always be safely placed
on the classical side of the boundary, might there be no
boundary at all? 

We would expect a lot of coherence from a linear evolution of the universe state vector. A lot of entanglement that we do not see in reality. Classicality has to be an emergent phenomanon from quantum systems

> our perception of a reality with
alternatives and not a coherent superposition of alterna-
tives demands an explanation of when, where and how it is
decided what the observer actually perceives.

Macroscopic quantum systems are never isolated from the environment. This is the key thought
