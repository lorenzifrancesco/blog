 I'm a passionate Ph.D. student of Theoretical Physics of Matter, at the department of Physics and Astronomy of University of Padova.
I have background in optics and photonics for telecommunications.

My current research interests are in theoretical physic of matter: 
- solitons and their stability in classical and quantum field theories 
- highly nonlinear phenomena in Bose-Einstein condensates, Josephson oscillations

Due to my background in photonic engineering and ICT, I'm also interested in 
- classical and quantum optical communications in optical fibers
- nonlinear fiber optics
- microwave engineering

Other personal interests are philosophy of science, post-structuralism, science and technology studies (STS), music.
